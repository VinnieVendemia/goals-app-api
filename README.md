# Goals App Api

Backend implementation for the Goals App I'm currently building. RESTFUL api built on node and express.  

Following the instructions in this (Tutorial)[https://scotch.io/tutorials/speed-up-your-restful-api-development-in-node-js-with-swagger] during initial implementation, then adapted to meet use case for my application.

```
$ npm install
```
